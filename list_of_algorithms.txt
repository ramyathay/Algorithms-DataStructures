check the following resources or do some google search to prepare your interview:

Glassdoor- This site allows you to access questions from past candidates for a particular company. As I said above, you can get questions asked by Facebook last month for example.

Programming Interview Questions | CareerCup . I use this site similar to Glassdoor. The most valuable part to me is again real questions from my targeted company.

http://www.leetcode.com . This is one of the  most popular sites for preparing code interview. It has a lot of interesting questions and you code will be tested online.

Gainlo - Mock Interview . You will get mock interview from people working at Google, Facebook etc. and get real feedbacks. The most valuable part to me is getting real feedback about my disadvantages and how I can improve.

topcoder . This would be an optional resource for most people. Previously I only used this site for fun. It is one of the most popular online coding contest platform. Questions are usually much harder than those in real interview. But you're gonna have a lot of fun for sure.

Cracking the Coding Interview: Gayle Laakmann McDowell I'll second this book one more time here. Since it gives you a lot of basic knowledge of how to prepare code interview.
